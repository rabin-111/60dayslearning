# Side Effects in React

In the context of React, `side effects` refer to operations or behaviors that occur outside the scope of the typical component rendering process. These can include data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, and other actions that have an impact beyond rendering the user interface.

Thus, "side effects" are the operations outside the usual rendering process, and "hooks," like **`useEffect`**, are mechanisms provided by React to handle these side effects in functional components. The **`useEffect`** hook allows you to incorporate side effects into your components in a clean and organized manner.

# React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that allow functional components in React to have state and lifecycle features that were previously available only in class components. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to enable developers to use state and other React features without writing a class.


Using these hooks, developers can manage state, handle side effects, optimize performance, and create more reusable and readable functional components in React applications. Each hook serves a specific purpose, contributing to a more modular and maintainable codebase.

Some commonly used React Hooks are:

## 1. useState()

`useState` is a React Hook that enables functional components to manage state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value.

Here's an example of how to use `useState`:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // Using useState to initialize count state with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Event handler to increment count
  const increment = () => {
    // Using the setCount function to update the count state
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
export default Counter;
â€‹
In this example:
We import the useState function from the 'react' package.
Inside the Counter component, we use useState(0) to initialize the state variable count with an initial value of 0.
The count state and the setCount function are destructured from the array returned by useState.
The increment function updates the count state by calling setCount(count + 1) when the button is clicked.
The current value of the count state is displayed within a paragraph element.
The above example helps us understand how useState helps manage and update state in functional components, providing a straightforward way to incorporate stateful behavior into React applications.
2. useEffect()
useEffect is a React Hook used for performing side effects in functional components. It is often used for tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect will run after the component is mounted
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        // Simulating a data fetching operation
        const response = await fetch('<https://api.example.com/data>');
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    // Effect cleanup (will run before unmounting)
    return () => {
      console.log('Component will unmount. Cleanup here.');
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means the effect runs once after mount

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataFetcher;
In this example:

1. We import `useState` and `useEffect` from 'react'.
2. Inside the `DataFetcher` component, we use `useState` to manage the state of the `data` variable.
3. The `useEffect` hook is employed to perform the data fetching operation when the component is mounted. The empty dependency array `[]` ensures that the effect runs only once after the initial render.
4. The `fetchData` function, declared inside the effect, simulates an asynchronous data fetching operation. Upon success, it updates the `data` state.
5. The component returns content based on whether the data has been fetched.

## 3. useMemo()

`useMemo` is a React Hook that is used to memoize the result of a computation, preventing unnecessary recalculations when the component re-renders. It takes a function (referred to as the "memoized function") and an array of dependencies. The memoized function will only be recomputed when the values in the dependencies array change.

Here's an example of how to use `useMemo`:

import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveCalculation = ({ value }) => {
  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
    // Simulating a computationally expensive operation
    console.log('Calculating expensive result...');
    return value * 2;
  }, [value]); // Dependency array: recalculates when 'value' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Value: {value}</p>
      <p>Expensive Result: {expensiveResult}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const MemoExample = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(5);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(Number(e.target.value))}
      />
      <ExpensiveCalculation value={inputValue} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MemoExample;
1. We import `useState` and `useMemo` from 'react'.
2. The `ExpensiveCalculation` component takes a prop `value` and uses `useMemo` to calculate an "expensive" result based on that value.
3. The dependency array `[value]` indicates that the memoized function should be recomputed whenever the `value` prop changes.
4. The `MemoExample` component renders an `input` element and the `ExpensiveCalculation` component. The `value` prop of `ExpensiveCalculation` is set to the current state of `inputValue`.
5. As you type in the input, you'll notice that the expensive result is only recalculated when the input value changes, thanks to `useMemo`.

> `useMemo` is particularly useful when dealing with expensive calculations or when you want to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computations during renders. It's important to use it judiciously, as overusing memoization can lead to increased compl

## 4. useCallback()

`useCallback` is a React Hook that is used to memoize a callback function, preventing unnecessary re-creation of the callback on each render. This can be useful when passing callbacks to child components to ensure they don't trigger unnecessary renders.

import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendering...');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
};

const CallbackExample = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Regular callback function
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };

  // Memoized callback using useCallback
  const memoizedHandleClick = useCallback(handleClick, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <ChildComponent onClick={memoizedHandleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CallbackExample;
