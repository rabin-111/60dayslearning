# 60dayslearning
60 days of learning is a commitment to study consistently for 60 days. I will be learning web development where,I already learned html,css,js and foundation of react . But I will be starting from react js and go deep dive into backend . I have decent knowledge of frontend by now i will try to learn as much as I can in web. So let the challenge begin

I have decent knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can create simple web pages and understand the basics of web development.Its my day1 of leapfrog where i will start learning web again from reactjs and i will go continue learning nextjs, backend concepts and the things that are required to become a full stack developer..
i already have small knowledge on reacjs and i have created a lot of webpages , but it wasnot consistent enough. I will have a consistent and managed  approach to learning web development this time.

my roadmap includes
reactjs

react deep dive
 nextjs
 some of left out mongoDB topics.
 projects
 tailwind css
 typescript
postgres
and go deep dive into backend concepts
