states --> a variable that determine the behavior and appearance of a component at a given time.
useful when real backend sends data . a strong concept in react.

--> dom manipulation is very hard doing with js and its only way to create dynamic website. so we do it with reactjs which underthe hood itself does dom manipulation.
--> REACT calculates the differences.
--> npm create vite@latest
-- vite create boilerplate for any lang.

--> import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client' 
this does adding react to dom and removing the browser dom.

-->understanding app.jsx here.
manipulated app.jsx and experimented it and hosted.
--> import/export /some function and return.


-->why return have html here? [ ans: its in .jsx format ]
there is formatting going on in app.css and index.css
so it looked so clean.

here react is doing the same in very managed and cleaner code. it is dynamic and managed compared to yesterday day2 code . 
hence we use react , its manipulating dom elements under the hood.
 
 
 here count is a state variable --> react aggressively looks at its value.
